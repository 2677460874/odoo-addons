    'name': 'Invoice Line with Different Precision',
    'version': '0.2',
    'category': 'Accounting / Invoicing',
    'description': """
This module corrects the following limitations in OpenERP standard modules:
- In standard accounting module, all objects in the invoice line (unit price, subtotal, etc) are setup following
decimal precision given by 'Account' (eg: 2).
- In standard product module, standard cost in product_template is defined following 'Account' decimal precision.

This module introduces a new decimal precision 'Account Line' so that you can have prices in Invoice Line with different accuracy (eg:4)
This means that you can have 2 digits for the invoice total calculation and 4 digits for the invoice details and unit price. 

Additionally, we apply the same decimal precision 'Account Line' to the standard cost in product_template and stock_move.
